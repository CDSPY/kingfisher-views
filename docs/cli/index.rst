Command-line tools
==================

The ``ocdskingfisher-views-cli`` script at the root of the repository provides access to a suite of command-line tools for :doc:`setting up<setup>`, :doc:`using<use>` and :doc:`developing<develop>` Kingfisher Views.

To see all available commands, change to the directory containing your copy of the repository, and run:

.. code-block:: bash

   python ocdskingfisher-views-cli --help

To see the help message for a specific command, run, for example:

.. code-block:: bash
